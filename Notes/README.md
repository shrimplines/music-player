iPod Spotify Widget
basically a iPod for your desktop
it lets you control spotify (using skip forward/back and pause)

what it does
works: uses powershell to send signals
looks: stays on top of everything
draggable: drag and drop wherever

work in progress
1. recolor/customization options
2. syncing with spotify to show album cover, artist, song and progress
3. resizable

how to get it running
clone it
install: npm install
go: npm start

important!!
spotify ads: if an ad is playing, it probably won't skip
focus: if its not doing anything, close/reopen spotify
