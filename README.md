# ‧₊˚ iPod Media Widget ˚₊‧

### basically a tiny iPod for your desktop ‧₊˚✧

it lets you control spotify (or other forms of playing media) using the skip forward/back and pause buttons on the click wheel.


## ✧ what it does

* **actually works**: it uses powershell to send signals to windows so spotify actually listens to the buttons.
* **vibe**: it stays on top of all your other windows so it's always there.
* **draggable**: you can just click the iPod shell and drag it wherever you want on your screen.

## ✧ work in progress

1. recolor/customization options (make it pink??)
2. syncing with spotify to show album cover, artist, song and progress.
3. resizable (tiny or huge)

## ✧ how to get it running

**you will need:**

* **Node.js**: this is the "engine" that runs the code. you can download it from the official website.
* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: this is where you open the folder and run the commands.

**steps:**

1. **clone it**: download the code or use `git clone https://github.com/shrimplines/music-player.git` in your terminal.
2. **open in vs code**: open the folder you just downloaded.
3. **install**: open the terminal in VS Code (hit `Ctrl + ~`) and type `npm install` then hit enter.
4. **go**: type `npm start` and the iPod should pop up!

## ✧ important!!

* **spotify ads**: if an ad is playing, it probably won't let you skip. that's just how spotify works.
* **focus**: if it’s not doing anything, try clicking on your spotify window once and then clicking the iPod again. or just close/reopen spotify.
